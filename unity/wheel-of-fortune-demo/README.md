# Wheel of Fortune Demo

The Wheel of Fortune is a Unity game that lets users perform on-chain wheel spinning and get on-chain rewards. The demo uses the smart contract located [here](https://github.com/aura-nw/wheel-of-fortune).

## Test the demo

The demo is designed on Android, iOS, and WebGL. We have tested the app on Android 9, Android 13, iOS 16, and iOS 12, and due to the fact that the app doesn't require special permissions, it should work on other operating system versions as well.

- Method 1: Clone the repo and build it to your device. Our default settings have been tested working with the versions specified below.
- Method 2 (For Android Testing): Download our prebuilt apk in the ```Build``` folder and install it on your Android devices. Do not forget to turn on ```Install from Unknown sources``` in your Device Security settings.
- Method 3 (For iOS Testing): This [Testflight link](https://testflight.apple.com/join/fvI7XTal) should get you to the beta version of the app. The app is published by Khoa Minh Ho as our TestFlight account administrator.
