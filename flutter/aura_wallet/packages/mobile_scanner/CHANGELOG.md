* [Android] Updated com.google.mlkit:barcode-scanning from 17.0.3 to 17.1.0

Bugs fixed:

* [iOS] Explicit returned type for compactMap

## 3.1.1
Bugs fixed:
* [iOS] Fixed a bug that caused a crash when switching from camera.

## 3.1.0
Improvements:
* [iOS] No longer automatically focus on faces.
* [iOS] Fixed build error.
* [Web] Waiting for js libs to load.
* Do not returnImage if not specified.
* Added raw data in barcode object.
* Fixed several bugs.

## 3.0.0
This big release contains all improvements from the beta releases.
In addition to that, this release contains:

Improvements:
* Fixed an issue in which the scanner would freeze if two scanner widgets where placed in a page view,
and the paged was swiped. An example has been added in the example app.
You need to set startDelay: true if used in a page view.
* [Web] Automatically inject js libraries.
* [macOS] The minimum build version is now macOS 10.14 in according to the latest Flutter version.
* [Android] Fixed an issue in which the scanWindow would remain even after disposing the scanner.
* Updated dependencies.

## 3.0.0-beta.4
Fixes:
* Fixes a permission bug on Android where denying the permission would cause an infinite loop of permission requests.
* Updates the example app to handle permission errors with the new builder parameter.
  Now it no longer throws uncaught exceptions when the permission is denied.
* Updated several dependencies

Features:
* Added a new `errorBuilder` to the `MobileScanner` widget that can be used to customize the error state of the preview. (Thanks @navaronbracke !) 

## 3.0.0-beta.3
Deprecated:
* The `onStart` method has been renamed to `onScannerStarted`.
* The `onPermissionSet` argument of the `MobileScannerController` is now deprecated.

Breaking changes:
* `MobileScannerException` now uses an `errorCode` instead of a `message`.
* `MobileScannerException` now contains additional details from the original error.
* Refactored `MobileScannerController.start()` to throw `MobileScannerException`s
  with consistent error codes, rather than string messages.
  To handle permission errors, consider catching the result of `MobileScannerController.start()`.
* The `autoResume` attribute has been removed from the `MobileScanner` widget.
  The controller already automatically resumes, so it had no effect.
* Removed `MobileScannerCallback` and `MobileScannerArgumentsCallback` typedef.
* [Web] Replaced `jsqr` library with `zxing-js` for full barcode support.

Improvements:
* Toggling the device torch now does nothing if the device has no torch, rather than throwing an error.
* Removed `called stop while already stopped` messages.

Features:
* You can now provide a `scanWindow` to the `MobileScanner()` widget.
* You can now draw an overlay over the scanned barcode. See the barcode scanner window in the example app for more information.
* Added a new `placeholderBuilder` function to the `MobileScanner` widget to customize the preview placeholder.
* Added `autoStart` parameter to MobileScannerController(). If set to false, controller won't start automatically.
* Added `hasTorch` function on MobileScannerController(). After starting the controller, you can check if the device has a torch.
* [iOS] Support `torchEnabled` parameter from MobileScannerController() on iOS
* [Web] Added ability to use custom barcode scanning js libraries 
  by extending `WebBarcodeReaderBase` class and changing `barCodeReader` property in `MobileScannerWebPlugin`

Fixes:
* Fixes the missing gradle setup for the Android project, which prevented gradle sync from working.
* Fixes `MobileScannerController.stop()` throwing when already stopped.
* Fixes `MobileScannerController.toggleTorch()` throwing if the device has no torch.
  Now it does nothing if the torch is not available.
* Fixes a memory leak where the `MobileScanner` would keep listening to the barcode events.
* Fixes the `MobileScanner` preview depending on all attributes of `MediaQueryData`.
  Now it only depends on its layout constraints.
* Fixed a potential crash when the scanner is restarted due to the app being resumed.
* [iOS] Fix crash when changing torch state
  
## 3.0.0-beta.2
Breaking changes:
* The arguments parameter of onDetect is removed. The data is now returned by the onStart callback
in the MobileScanner widget.
* onDetect now returns the object BarcodeCapture, which contains a List of barcodes and, if enabled, an image.
* allowDuplicates is removed and replaced by MobileScannerSpeed enum.
* onPermissionSet in MobileScanner widget is deprecated and will be removed. Use the onPermissionSet
onPermissionSet callback in MobileScannerController instead.
* [iOS] The minimum deployment target is now 11.0 or higher.

Features:
* The returnImage is working for both iOS and Android. You can enable it in the MobileScannerController.
The image will be returned in the BarcodeCapture object provided by onDetect.
* You can now control the DetectionSpeed, as well as the timeout of the DetectionSpeed. For more
info see the DetectionSpeed documentation. This replaces the allowDuplicates function.

Other improvements:
* Both the [iOS] and [Android] codebases have been refactored completely.
* [iOS] Updated POD dependencies
